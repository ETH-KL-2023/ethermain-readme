# Ethermain
**The onchain TLD registry and web domain registrar, that web3 deserves.**

## Problem
Our existing DNS is conceived during a time where crypto has not been invented. As such, it has not been designed to handle websites with billions of dollars at stake.

The registrar is the weak point of our current DNS architecture: numerous crypto exploits have arisen as a result of DNS-related hacks, not the underlying smart contracts. Web3 applications, no matter how secure their contracts or infrastructure, will always operate under the perpetual risk of front-end compromises, through no fault of their own. Registrar data leaks, system vulnerabilities, lax security / opsec hygiene, compromised login credentials, impersonation attacks – you name it!

In addition, when you buy a web domain through a conventional registrar like GoDaddy or Namecheap, you are mandated to dox your real-world details (banking info, home addresses, etc.). You're also subjected to the TOCs of each registrar – you never truly "own" your domain, as they have the power to unilaterally suspend / revoke your domain.

## Solution
Ethermain leverages the incorruptible nature of Ethereum smart contracts to guarantee the integrity of domain records stored within its onchain TLD registry: the only way for anyone to “hack” your domain (changing NS and DS records) is if your private key is compromised.

Also, goodbye walled gardens of centralized registrars: your domain is now free from the closed environment of its registrar. Trading Ethermain web domains, is as easy as trading ERC20s or NFTs. Wrap your web domain as an NFT, and use it to participate in DeFi.

*PS: Unlike predecessors before us (i.e., ENS, Unstoppable Domains, Handshake), Ethermain is designed to be fully compatible with our existing DNS system. The DNS is a highly intricate system spanning decades ever since the internet was born – the premise of the entire internet supporting an alt root is extremely infeasible (involving modifications to ISPs, SSL/TLS, CDN, and the entire chain of security systems built on top of each other).*

### Why Ethermain?
We allow end users the novel option of purchasing / trading / managing web domains completely onchain via our user-friendly interface. Without our solution, web domains would be largely siloed to centralized platforms like GoDaddy or Namecheap, where secondary liquidity for web domains is siloed to each of their respective environments. Only a crypto address (and some coins) is enough for you to purchase a web domain: no KYC, no banking / traditional financial rails doxxing your personal information.

Web domains can be wrapped as NFTs, making whoever owns the NFT the rightful owner of the web domain in our onchain registry contract. Only those holding this NFT can edit / modify records. Also, NFTs can be used to participate in DeFi: collateralization, derivatives, you name it!

Ethermain is inherently a public good: we disintermediate the role of registries and registrars within the traditional DNS system in one fell swoop. Users interact with our contracts to register, buy, sell, and manage DNS of ".emn" domains. Front-ends hosted under a domain with Ethermain TLD (".emn") are way more secure than if their domains are managed by centralized registrars, which present a single point-of-failure. For web3 applications to truly be secure (and achieve mass adoption), besides securing its underlying smart contracts, it is of utmost importance for them to be hosted under an equally secure front-end under a web3 native web domain.  This is what Ethermain will enable: a public good that is useful for everyone in web3.
